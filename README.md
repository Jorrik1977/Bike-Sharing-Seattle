# Bike-Sharing-Seattle

This project is an data analysis and prediction (based mostly on weather data) about the cycling behaviour of users of a stationary bike-sharing system in Seattle, USA. These were either members with an annual subscription or day pass user. 54 Stations provide 500 bikes to all borrower. The dataset includes 236.000 single bike trips between 10/2014 and 09/2016.

The first three notebooks are about cleaning each dataset for EDA and prediction purposes.
